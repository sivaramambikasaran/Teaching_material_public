		Assume that Carlsen meets Ding Liren in the $2020$ chess championship. The championship match consists of a sequence of games and each game has three outcomes (i) Ding Liren winning, (ii) Carlsen winning, (iii) A draw. The first player to win a game wins the match. For instance, we could have a sequence of $3$ draws followed by a Carlsen victory in the $4^{th}$ game, which would mean that Carlsen wins the Championship. The probability of a single game ending in
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item
			Carlsen's favour is $0.4$
			\item
			Ding Liren's favour is $0.2$
			\item
			draw is $0.4$
		\end{enumerate}
		\begin{enumerate}[i]
			\item
			What is the probability of Ding Liren winning the championship?
			\item
			What is the probability of Carlsen winning the championship?
			\item
			What is the Probability Mass Function for the number of games played in the championship?
		\end{enumerate}
		\item
		Consider rolling a pair of fair dice. Let $X$ denote the difference between the numbers that show up on the dice, i.e., $X = \abs{D_1-D_2}$, where $D_i$ is the number that shows up on the $i^{th}$ dice.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item
			What are the possible values for $X$?
			\item
			What is the probability mass function for $X$?
			\item
			Find the expected value and standard deviation of $X$.
		\end{itemize}
		\item
		A fair die is rolled repeatedly till an odd prime appears. What is the probability that the number of rolls exceed $5$?
		\item
		Let $X$ be a discrete random variable with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. Prove that
		$$\mathbb{E}\left[\bkt{X-a}^2\right] = \sigma^2 + \bkt{a-\mu}^2$$
		Hence, prove that the mean (or expected value) minimizes $\mathbb{E}\left[\bkt{X-a}^2\right]$.
		\item
		A production process is partitioned into two independent sub-processes. The probabilities of a defective component in the first and second sub-processes are $0.01$ and $0.02$, respectively. If $50$ units are produced, what is the probability there will be fewer than $3$ defective units?
		\item
		Communication channels do not always trasmit the correct signal. Suppose that for a particular channel the error rate is $1$ in $100$, i.e., the probability of incorrect transmission is $1/100$. If $2000$ messages are sent in a given week, and it is assumed that their transmissions are independent, what is the probability that there will be at least $5$ errors?
		\item
		A casino offers a game of chance for a single player in which a fair coin is tossed at each stage. The initial stake starts at $\$ 1$ and is increased by $\$ 1$ every time heads appears. The first time tails appears, the game ends and the player wins whatever is in the pot. Thus the player wins $\$1$ dollar if tails appears on the first toss, $\$2$ dollars if heads appears on the first toss and tails on the second, $\$3$ dollars if heads appears on the first two tosses and tails on the third, and so on. Mathematically, the player wins $\$k$ dollars, when we have the first $k-1$ tosses to be heads and the $k^{th}$ toss to be a tail. The casino demands a pay of $\$3$ to enter the game. Will you play the game?
		\item
		Repeat the above if the price money was $2^k$ instead of $k$ and the casino demands a pay of $\$100$ to enter the game. Will you still be willing to play the game? (For more details, look up St. Petersburg paradox)
		\item
		If $X$ is a discrete random variable, prove that (i) $\mathbb{E}\left[aX +b\right] = a \mathbb{E}\left[X\right] + b$ and (ii) $\text{Var}\left[aX +b\right] = a^2 \text{Var}\bkt{X}$
		\item
		Data shows that $5\%$ of the individuals reserving tables at a restaurant will not appear. If the restaurant has $50$ tables and takes $52$ reservations, what is the probability that it will be able to accommodate everyone appearing?
		\item
		Electrical power failures in a workplace are modeled as a Poisson experiment with a rate of one every two months.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item
			What is the probability of having more than $10$ failures in a year?
			\item
			What is the probability that the number of failures in a year will differ by more than a standard deviation from the expected number?
		\end{enumerate}
		\item
		Table~\ref{table_1} below indicates the joint probabilities

		\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
			\hline
			& Sunny & Rainy\\

			Power cut & $0.2$ & $0.15$ \\

			No power cut & $0.6$ & $p$\\

		\end{tabular}
		\label{table_1}
		\end{center}
		\end{table}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item
			Find $p$.
			\item
			What is the probability that there won't be rain for one week?
			\item
			What is the probability that there will be at least one power in the next three days?
			\item
			Is there a dependence between weather and power cuts?
			\item
			Find the joint probability, all marginal probabilities, and all conditional probabilities.
